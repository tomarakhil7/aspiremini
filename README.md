There are few entities in project like 
Loan, Loan status, Payments, Payment status, User.
Everything related to loan is stored inside loan entity.
I am using in memory data structures to store the data. 

Loan App Class is exposing all the required APIs like createLoan, createUser, showLoanInfo, repayLoan
LoanAppTest is basically providing unit test for overall functionality. 

To run this project simply load it inside any JAVA idea like intellij or ecllipse and run unit tests to get the flavour of overall code changes.
